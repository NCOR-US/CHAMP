# CHAMP
This is a repository for the Coordinated Holistic Alignment of Manufacturing Processes (CHAMP) Project -- a DMDII-funded project whose goal is to represent the domain of the Product Life Cycle in a suite of mid-level ontologies that may be extended in applications to integrate data both within industrial organizations and across them. 

Here, you will find the suite of ontology files saved in the turtle format. The ontologies extend from Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the Relations Ontology (RO), as well as the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) developed by CUBRC. 

In addition, there are two applications available here: Process Workflow and Ontoview. The former is an ingestion tool with an RDF-backend to support saving and re-using information throughout a mapping process; the latter is a query tool that improves on the typical SPARQL endpoint by allowing users to 'build-up' queries by browsing RDF data.
