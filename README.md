# CHAMP
A repository for the ontologies and other files developed as part of the Coordinated Holistic Alignment of Manufacturing Processes (CHAMP) Project -- a DMDII-funded project whose goal is to represent the Product Life Cycle in a set of mid-level ontologies that may be extended to integrate data both within industrial organizations and across them. The ontologies extend from Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as well as the Common Core Ontologies (CCO).
